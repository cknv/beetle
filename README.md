Beetle
======

Beetle is a simple static site generator, mostly driven by NIH thinking and a desire to have very little dictated from the engine.

So far, it works for me (TM), and I think I can guarentee that you will find it clunky and hard to work with. Especially from the lack of documentation.

I should give credit where credit is due, so:

* Armin Ronacher for his RSTBlog that really got me interested in making a static blog engine.
* Mike Cooper for wok, and showing me there is a simple way to make a static blog - I could easily have ended up using wok or a patched version thereof.
* Jeff Knupp for pointing out that it's ok to make your own static blog engine, since it's so simple.

Gaps and missing stuff:
-----------------------
There are some areas that I know I want to work on and improve, these are:

* Page defaults by category.
* Content rendering by file extentions.
* Multipages.
* Beter subpage handling and pagination thereof.

Name
----

Right now, this code is not published at pypi. Currently the name beetle is not taken (as far as I can see on pypi), but that may change. So I may have to rename the project if that happens, who knows?
